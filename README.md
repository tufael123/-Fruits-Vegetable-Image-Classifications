# 🥦 Fruits & Vegetables Image Classification

This is a machine learning-based image classification project that identifies different types of fruits and vegetables using a trained deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The project also features a simple and interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Supports multiple categories (e.g., apple, banana, bell pepper, etc.)
- Streamlit-powered web app for real-time prediction
- User-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images

🖥️ How to Run the App

1. Clone the repo:

```

git clone [https://github.com/SyedSami07/Fruits-Vegetable-Image-Classifications.git](https://github.com/SyedSami07/Fruits-Vegetable-Image-Classifications.git)
cd "fruit and vegetables img classifications"

```

2. Install dependencies:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:

```

pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy

```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```

streamlit run app.py

```

4. Upload an image and see the classification result!
